# Improv Rewards Token 

[IMPROV on SLP Explorer](https://explorer.bitcoin.com/bch/tx/d677b96105001c5aa0803ca36e034d9ae070e67b28861090a5148353496fc7e1)

Tired of paying to attend improv shows and workshops? No more! Introducing Improv Rewards Token. This token was minted this morning and will be used as a way to grow & develop an international and free (as in beer) community of like-minded individuals that love to improvise on stage, at work, or life in general. You'll be able to earn these tokens (which will give you access to any Improv.pl and partner events) by doing any of the following:

* attending our LIVE show
* attending our Online show
* volunteering during a show
* appearing in our podcast as a guest
* teaching at one of our workshops
* attending one of our workshops
* writing content for our blog
* promoting our events online
* mentoring our Improv performers
* attending partner Improv shows*
* volunteering at a Non-profit/NGO

This coin will never be exchanged for money. It is not a monetary instrument. The sole purpose is to create a way to share efforts across tasks to ensure everyone is rewarded for their contributions to the community in a fair way. The more you contribute the more you can share Improv with your friends, family, and random people online.
